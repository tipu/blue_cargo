Requires python3.6 and virtualenv.

This is a Django app that serves the scraped data via a webapp. It's a typical Django app that has a dependency on Redis. Update the <project_root>/app/app/settings.py and change `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` to a Redis instance available to you or one that I've hosted at 23.239.4.75 on port 9992.

Run (assuming at <project_root>/app):

virtualenv .venv -p python3
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./manage.py runserver
